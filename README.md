# JS-Alert-Input-Demonstration
A demonstration of implementing an input system via the the alert prompt in JavaScript.

# Overview
This project was created for a college assignment. The primary function of this code is to display an example of a JavaScript implementation of user input. Specifically, it will prompt input from the user and get the input with the HTML alert prompt. The two prompts will ask for different data and store the data in variables. Upon entry of data, the program will relay the data back to the user with a user-friendly and high-level response. In addition to input prompts, the program will ask for a number input and return the area of a circle given the number as a radius.
